# Claude Conductor

> A pattern (and a tiny toolkit) for combining **Claude Code's** reasoning with **Gemini CLI's** cheap throughput.

Claude Code is excellent at planning, decomposition, and judgment under ambiguity — and expensive on long agentic sessions because every read and every edit costs context tokens. Gemini CLI is the opposite trade-off: cheap and fast on bulk work, less reliable as a top-level architect.

**Claude Conductor** keeps Claude Code in the conductor seat and dispatches the heavy work to a swarm of 4–6 Gemini CLI workers in parallel. The conductor never reads the workers' full output — only short structured summaries.

The result: Claude Code spends its tokens on design, decomposition, and integration. Gemini does the typing.

## How it works

```
Claude Code (conductor)
   │  writes one *.prompt file per parallel worker
   ▼
scripts/gc-parallel.sh tasks/<batch>
   │  spawns 4–6 `gemini -p ...` workers concurrently
   ▼
Workers write code/files directly to the project tree (yolo mode)
   │  emit STATUS / FILES / NOTES summary (<500 chars)
   ▼
Claude Code reads only the *.summary and *.exitcode files
```

Three kinds of workers do the heavy lifting, with model selection tuned to each role:

| Worker | Purpose | Mode | Default model |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Recon** | Read the codebase once and produce a structured map (LAYERS, KEY_MODULES, CONVENTIONS, CHECK_COMMANDS). Replaces Claude reading source files. | read-only | `gemini-3-pro-preview` |
| **Implementer** | Do the actual edits. 4–6 in parallel by default. | write | `gemini-3-flash-preview` |
| **Reviewer** | Audit the diff after a batch and report BLOCKERS/WARNINGS/NITS. Replaces Claude reading code to verify. | read-only | `gemini-3-pro-preview` |

Reviewers come in **four perspectives**: `general`, `security`, `perf`, `api`. Run them alone or all-at-once with `--aspects all`. With `--until-clean`, the reviewer can also drive an autoloop: review → auto-dispatch a fix worker → re-review, repeating until clean or `--max-iters` (default 3) is hit.

**v0.4** adds three things on top:
- **Per-worker retry + quota-aware fallback** (`--retries N --fallback-model NAME`) so one transient 429 doesn't kill a whole parallel batch.
- **Token telemetry** — every worker writes `<id>.usage.json` with prompt/completion/total tokens; per batch a `_batch.usage.json` aggregates. New `scripts/gc-stats.sh` rolls these up over `--since 24h` (or any window) and reports estimated cost.
- **Diff-pack pre-build for reviewers** — `gc-review.sh` runs `git diff` once and feeds the result to all aspect reviewers as context, instead of each reviewer re-issuing git commands. Reduces redundant tokens and round-trip latency on multi-aspect runs.

Operating guide: [`docs/usage.md`](docs/usage.md). Rules Claude itself follows: [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md). Rationale and heuristics: [`docs/workflow.md`](docs/workflow.md), [`docs/token-budget.md`](docs/token-budget.md). `CLAUDE.md` is auto-loaded by Claude Code when a session starts in this repo.

## Requirements

- **Claude Code** (CLI) — https://claude.com/claude-code
- **Gemini CLI** ≥ 0.39 — https://geminicli.com (`npm i -g @google/gemini-cli` or equivalent)
- **bash** ≥ 4.3 (Git Bash on Windows works)
- **git**

## Quick start

```bash
git clone git@github.com:masaki-09/Claude_Conductor.git
cd Claude_Conductor

# Verify environment
scripts/gc-check.sh

# (a) Run the implementer example end-to-end (2 parallel workers)
scripts/gc-parallel.sh examples/hello-batch --max-parallel 2
cat examples/hello-batch/*.summary

# (b) Run a recon on this repo and read the structured map
scripts/gc-recon.sh --out tasks/_recon/recon.md "Recon this repository"
cat tasks/_recon/recon.md
```

Then start Claude Code from this directory:

```bash
claude
```

`CLAUDE.md` is auto-loaded. Tell Claude *"use Conductor mode"* and proceed normally — Claude will run recon, dispatch parallel implementers with the recon as context, and run a reviewer between batches, all on its own. See [`docs/usage.md`](docs/usage.md) for the full operator's guide.

## Using Conductor in another project

Two options:

**Option A — clone alongside, reference by path.**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:masaki-09/Claude_Conductor.git ~/tools/Claude_Conductor
cd ~/your/project
ln -s ~/tools/Claude_Conductor/CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md   # or copy
# Use scripts via absolute path:
~/tools/Claude_Conductor/scripts/gc-parallel.sh tasks/batch1
```

**Option B — add as a submodule.**

```bash
cd ~/your/project
git submodule add git@github.com:masaki-09/Claude_Conductor.git .conductor
ln -s .conductor/CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md
.conductor/scripts/gc-parallel.sh tasks/batch1
```

Either way, `CLAUDE.md` should be present at the project root so Claude Code picks it up.
